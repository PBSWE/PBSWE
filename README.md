### About 

💬 Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast. Passionate about music, fitness and health.  <br>
 <br>
 
💡 I enjoy helping businesses make better decisions through data. I am experienced in data collection, cleaning/formatting, exploratory data analysis, visualization plots and machine learning fine tuning for better predictions. All of that happens in compelling storytelling, visualizations-rich presentations that convey the message effectively to stakeholders, so that data insights turn into data-driven decisions in the real world.  <br>
 <br>
 
🔭 I'm currently working on a Data Science and Machine Learning prediction model with a Spotify dataset from Kaggle that contains the most popular songs from the past decade. The model learns each song attribute and how the popularity is ranked and then predicts the popularity of newer songs based on its attributes. It's available right here on GitHub. Look for 'Spotify' on my repositories.  <br>
 <br>
 
🌱 I'm currently learning about Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Tensorflow and Markov Stochastic and State Models. Not to mention Relational Database models (RDBMS) and SQL, Software Development through a Bachelor's degree from Western Governors University.  <br>

⚡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I like to compose and produce music 🎶. I have been doing this ever since I was young (not that I'm not young still) and I've used many DAWs (digital audio workspace 🎹) such as FL Studio, SoundForge, Reason and LogicX Pro. <br>
<br>

⚡⚡ A couple of years ago I connected with a local singer 💃🏼 in Las Vegas and asked if she would agree to sing some lyrics I wrote. She did, we recorded 🎤, she sounded amazing, I polished and finished the track 🥁🎷 and guess what? A record label 💽 in Netherlands heard it and wanted to release it worldwide 🌎 under their label! <br>
<br>

⚡⚡⚡ That and other tracks I composed/produced are available on iTunes 🎙, Amazon Music 📻, Deezer 🔉 and Spotify 🎧.
