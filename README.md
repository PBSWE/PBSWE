### About 

üí¨ Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast. Passionate about music, health and fitness. I enjoy helping businesses make better decisions through data. For that to happen, I am experienced in data collection, sanitization, exploratory data analysis, visualization plots and machine learning fine tuning for better predictions. All of that happens in a compeling sotrytelling, visualizations-rich presentation that conveys the message effectively to stakeholders, so that data insights turn into data-driven decisions in the real world. 

üî≠ I'm currently working on a Data Science and Machine Learning prediction model with a Spotify dataset from Kaggle that contains the most popular songs from the past decade.
